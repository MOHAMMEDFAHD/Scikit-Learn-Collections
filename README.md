## 🧠 Modules & Components

Here’s what you’ll find in the `scikitelearn-collections`:

| Module          | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transformers/` | Custom transformers (e.g., outlier removal, encoding, feature generators) |
| `pipelines/`    | Predefined reusable ML pipelines                                          |
| `wrappers/`     | Wrapper classes for models and metrics                                    |
| `utils/`        | General ML utilities (e.g., feature selection, imputation helpers)        |
| `validators/`   | Cross-validation strategies and metrics extensions                        |

## 🚀 Quick Start

Here’s how to integrate a custom transformer from the repo into your pipeline:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from scikitelearn_collections.transformers import OutlierRemover, DateFeatureGenerator

pipe = Pipeline([
    ("dates", DateFeatureGenerator(columns=["signup_date"])),
    ("outliers", OutlierRemover(method="zscore", threshold=3.0)),
    ("model", LogisticRegression())
])

pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 🧪 Example Use Case

See the [examples/](examples/) folder for full demonstrations on:

* Binary classification
* Regression pipelines
* Feature selection experiments
* Custom scorer integration
* GridSearchCV with wrappers
