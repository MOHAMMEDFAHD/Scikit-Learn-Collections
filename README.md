# 🤖 Scikit-Learn Collections
A curated collection of **scikit-learn** examples, utilities, and best practices — all in one place. Whether you're a beginner exploring machine learning or an advanced user looking for reusable snippets, this repo has you covered.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📚 Ready-to-run **examples** covering preprocessing, models, pipelines, and evaluation  
- 🔧 Handy **utilities** for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection  
- 🧪 Demonstrations of **scikit-learn’s latest features** with practical code snippets  
- 📝 Well-documented and easy-to-understand Jupyter notebooks  

---

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scikit-learn-collections.git
cd scikit-learn-collections
````

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (on Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Explore the examples directly:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

Or import utilities into your own project:

```python
from skl_utils.preprocessing import scale_features
from skl_utils.models import train_and_evaluate

X_scaled = scale_features(X)
train_and_evaluate(X_scaled, y)
```
